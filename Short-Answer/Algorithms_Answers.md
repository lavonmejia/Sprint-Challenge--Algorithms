#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
This snippet of pseudocode seems to have a linear runtime because it seems the time to run will grow at the same rate as input size increases.

b)
Polynomial runtime O(n^c) . As the size of the input increases, the runtime will grow at a faster rate.

c)
Linearithmic runtime O(n log n). As the size of the input increases, the runtime will grow at a tlightly faster rate.

## Exercise II

Implement binary search

List floors in an array (assume already ordered) Split the number of floors in the middle
create a left hand side array and a right hand side array
check to see if egg breaks at largest floor on LHS (smallest numbers)
if yes eliminate LHS
if no check to see if egg breaks at smallest floor on RHS, continue until egg breaks
